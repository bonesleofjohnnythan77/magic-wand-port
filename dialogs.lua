Take my advice: When you\
need to recover from\
injuries, collect coins.\
Yellow Coins refill one\
piece of the Power Meter,\
Red Coins refill two\
pieces, and Blue Coins\
refill five.\
\
To make Blue Coins\
appear, pound on Blue\
Coin Blocks.\

Also, if you fall from\
high places, you'll\
minimize damage if you\
Pound the Ground as you\
land."))
